> pseudo terminal renderer

??? renders its input into a PNG as if it was a terminal.
It understands what formatting related ANSI escape codes are.

## Usage
The intended use of ??? is to create screenshot like pictures of code and such,
without monitor-size or shaky-hand interference.

```
    xighligth FILE!!! | ???
```
Ouput:
![documentation/example.png]()

Following the UNIX philosphy however,
??? itself does not highlight code for you,
instead it assumes its input was intelligently formatted.

To highlight code, we recommend:
+ [xighlight]()
+ [bat]()

## CLI
```
    ??? [options]
        -h  : show help
        -o  : specify output file
        -f  : specify font
```
